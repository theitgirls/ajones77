<h1>Teachable Machines</h1>
<p>July 19th, 2022</p>
<p>Today in class, we worked withaa teachable machine website. During the lab, I learned how to teach the computer how to recognize and seperate different colors. In my group for the assignment, we decided to try to teach the computer how to distinguish purplr from blue. It was able to recognize the different colors, but when we tried to see if it could seperate light purples from light blues, it thought the light purple was blue. It was a really fun experience.

<h1>Scavenger Hunt</h1>
<p>July 20th, 2022</p>
<p>Today in class, we went on a scavenger hunt. We interviewed people in different departments about how technology influenced their work. It wasreally fun seeing the different jobs in each of the departments we were able to make it to. We had an hour time limit and there were 8 destinations. We were able to make it to 6 of the 8 destinations and the heat was horrible. We partially ran to any of the destinations while trying to get as many interviews as possible. My partners were reallly good at asking different questions and staying ingaged in the conversations.</p>

 <h1>Citizen Science</h1>
 <p>July 21st, 2022</p>
 <p>Today in class, we learned about citizen science. Citizen science is basically when people from all different age ranges and career fields find an issue and analys data together. During the class activity, my group searched up things about solar jets. We were supposed to learn about the projects, the projects goal, why we chose the project, how many people participated in the project, and how we could help make progress in the project. </p>

 <p>July 22nd, 2022</p>
 <p>Today, we learned about women in gaming and cyber security. The first thing we did was read an article about the first black female game designer. We also did a cybersyber security quiz. Our guest speaker was Chris Hanson and he showed us a few of the first video games ever created. We also were allowed to play them in the esports room and it was definately an experience. The games were hard to play because there wasnt any specific directions and if felt like I was just thrown into some random world with no objective. The only thing my partner and I did in the game was walk and get killed by different enimies. It felt like everything was just out to get us but I still had a lot of fun.</p>
