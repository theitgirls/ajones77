<h1>Teachable Machines</h1>
<p>July 19th, 2022</p>
<p>Today in class, we worked withaa teachable machine website. During the lab, I learned how to teach the computer how to recognize and seperate different colors. In my group for the assignment, we decided to try to teach the computer how to distinguish purplr from blue. It was able to recognize the different colors, but when we tried to see if it could seperate light purples from light blues, it thought the light purple was blue. It was a really fun experience.

<h1>Scavenger Hunt</h1>
<p>July 20th, 2022</p>
<p>Today in class, we went on a scavenger hunt. We interviewed people in different departments about how technology influenced their work. It wasreally fun seeing the different jobs in each of the departments we were able to make it to. We had an hour time limit and there were 8 destinations. We were able to make it to 6 of the 8 destinations and the heat was horrible. We partially ran to any of the destinations while trying to get as many interviews as possible. My partners were reallly good at asking different questions and staying ingaged in the conversations.</p>

 <h1>Citizen Science</h1>
 <p>July 21st, 2022</p>
 <p>Today in class, we learned about citizen science. Citizen science is basically when people from all different age ranges and career fields find an issue and analys data together. During the class activity, my group searched up things about solar jets. We were supposed to learn about the projects, the projects goal, why we chose the project, how many people participated in the project, and how we could help make progress in the project. </p>

 <h1>Women in Gaming</h1>
 <p>July 22nd, 2022</p>
 <p>Today, we learned about women in gaming and cyber security. The first thing we did was read an article about the first black female game designer. We also did a cybersyber security quiz. Our guest speaker was Chris Hanson and he showed us a few of the first video games ever created. We also were allowed to play them in the esports room and it was definately an experience. The games were hard to play because there wasnt any specific directions and if felt like I was just thrown into some random world with no objective. The only thing my partner and I did in the game was walk and get killed by different enimies. It felt like everything was just out to get us but I still had a lot of fun.</p>
 <h1>Cybersecurity</h1>
 <p>
  Cybersecurity is the protection of computer systems and networks from information disclosure, theft of, or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide. One of the issues that the speaker mentioned was apps tracking location. I think that cybersecurity will get better as we progres in th future. I think there might be a spike in cybersecurity threats from hackers but I have confidence that we'll be able to protect any personal information.

 <h1>Googlefu and Bias or Bust</h1>
 <p>July 25th, 2022</p>
 <p>Today we learned how to do different filtered google searches and what bias and bust was. We split our calss in half and tried to convince our guest speaker, who had a bias, why our oppinion was right. It was really difficult because we had to find what appeased the guess speaker and incorporate what they like into convincing them why our side was right. It was pretty difficult to fight against someones strong bias because for each scenario both good and bad things are brought up for each side. The point was to convince the guest speaker which side was more inconvenient for the speaker. It was a lot of fun but it was difficult when you try to defend something you don't really belive in. </p>

 <h1>Story Telling with Data</h1>
 <p>July 26th, 2022</p>
 <p>Today I learned about using data to tell stories. In class, we looked at a ton of pictures while attempting to assess the many narratives contained within the data visualizations.Today was very enjoyable because we had the chance to discuss our opinions of the information we had seen. It was also really intriguing how there were so many different topics represented virtually. I was also really interested in the information I was viewing because there was so much information to learn and record in an image. I want to focus on the one that caught my attention the mostâ€”someone who created a map of virtually every parking citation issued in Toronto between 2011 and 2020. That was intriguing to me because a sizable portion of the land was painted yellow to represent the amount of parking penalties. There was also a lot of white in this location, indicating that at least 5,000 parking citations had been issued there.
