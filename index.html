        Hi my name is Alexis Jones and I'm a raising senior. Im from long beach california. I decided to take this class because i wanted to learn more about potential career paths. I have interests in coding and cyber security. I like to dance, sing, play instruments and draw. I don't have any specific favorites interests.
